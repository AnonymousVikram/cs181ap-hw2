# Template overview

This template is designed to give you a starting point for authoring homework assignments using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/jupyter.html
). Open `report.html` for a rendered version of this document.

When creating a homework assignment, replace the content of this template with your report and replace the title and header information with the appropriate assignment, title and group members.

## Submitting

You should submit assignments as an HTML file. The sections below specify how to render either Quarto files or Jupyter Notebooks to HTML. Submit assignments as a group on Canvas.

## Getting set-up: Python

If you do not already have an existing python enviornment for working on this assignment. the included `setup.sh` script (for macos and linux) will create a python virtual enviornment in current directory and install a set of nessecary packages.

## Getting set-up: Jupyter

If you'd like to work directly in a jupyter notebook, you can work in the included `report.ipynb` notebook. Make sure not to delete the header information in the first cell.

With Quarto installed you can then render the notebook into an HTML page using the following command:
```{python}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: false
quarto preview report.ipynb --no-browser --no-watch-inputs
```


## Getting set-up: Quarto

The Quarto website has good instructions for setting up Quarto with [VSCode](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html).

In VSCode you can render this document by opening the menu at the top left and selecting `preview`:

If you'd prefer to work from the command line, then with Quarto installed you can render this document with the shell command:

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: false

quarto preview report.qmd --no-browser --no-watch-inputs
```

Either approach will (re-)create the file named `report.html`




# Quarto basics

The sections below go over some of the basic functions you can accomplish with quarto. See the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/guide) for many more details and examples.

## Formatting with Markdown

Basic formatting in Quarto is accomplished with [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html). 

A few basic markdown commands are worth knowing:

- `# Heading` creates a section heading as shown above.
    - `## Sub-heading` Adding more `#` marks indicated sub-headings
- `*italic*` creates *italicized text*
- `**bold**` creates **bolded text**
- `$equation$`$ creates a latex-style equation e.g. $y=ax+b$
- `![](path/to/image.png)` Embeds an image at the given path

## Writing code

Python code can be embedded in block as follows:

```{python}
print('Hello world')
```

This works with graphical outputs too:
```{python}
from lets_plot import *
import numpy as np
LetsPlot.setup_html()

ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=np.random.random(25), y=np.random.random(25)))
```

This template is designed to hide code in the output by default. If you'd like to force a code block to always be shown you can set the `code-fold` option to `false`. 

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
print('Hello world')
```
